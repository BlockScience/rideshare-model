    "### Rideshare Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "- Riders and drivers are placed randomly across all available zones with equal probability.\n",
    "- The matching algorithm is designed to find the nearest available driver for a rider's ride request. The driver must be in the 'idle' state and willing to accept the ride based on their preferences and the ride's metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matching \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Sort drivers**\n",
    "First, the algorithm sorts all drivers based on their distance from the rider's current zone. This sorting is done using the Manhattan distance between the driver's zone and the rider's zone. This ensures that the closest drivers are considered first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Iterate through drivers**\n",
    "Next, the algorithm iterates through the sorted list of drivers. For each driver, it performs the following checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Check driver's state**\n",
    "The driver must be in the 'idle' state, meaning they are available to take a new ride.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Calculate & compare acceptance threshold**\n",
    "The driver calculates an acceptance threshold for the ride based on their preferences and the ride's metadata. This threshold is determined by a weighted sum of the ride's attributes (cost, distance, duration, driver rating, and rider rating). The calculated acceptance threshold is compared with the driver's predefined acceptance threshold. If the calculated threshold is greater than or equal to the driver's acceptance threshold, the driver is willing to accept the ride.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Assign driver**\n",
    "If an idle driver willing to accept the ride is found, the algorithm returns this driver along with the calculated travel time to the rider's zone. If no such driver is found, the ride request may need to be re-evaluated with modified parameters (e.g., increased cost) until a suitable driver is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "---  \n",

    "The rideshare simulation consists of three main classes: `Zone`, `Driver`, `Rider`, and `RideRequest`. These classes work together to simulate the rideshare system."
