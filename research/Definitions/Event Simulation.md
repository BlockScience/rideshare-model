Event simulation encompasses various types, each with specific applications and methodologies. Here are the main types of event simulation:

1. **Discrete Event Simulation (DES)**:
   - **Definition**: Models the operation of a system as a sequence of discrete events. Each event occurs at a specific point in time and marks a change of state in the system.
   - **Applications**: Manufacturing processes, queueing systems, network traffic simulation.
   - **Example**: Simulating customer service operations where events include customer arrivals and service completions.

2. **Continuous Simulation**:
   - **Definition**: Represents systems where changes occur continuously over time, often described by differential equations.
   - **Applications**: Physical systems such as fluid dynamics, electrical circuits, and ecological models.
   - **Example**: Modeling the flow of water through a dam or the behavior of a population of animals over time.

3. **Agent-Based Simulation (ABS)**:
   - **Definition**: Uses autonomous agents, each with individual behaviors and interactions, to simulate the actions and interactions of entities.
   - **Applications**: Social sciences, economics, epidemiology, traffic simulation.
   - **Example**: Simulating the spread of a disease where each agent represents an individual with specific health behaviors and social interactions.

4. **Hybrid Simulation**:
   - **Definition**: Combines two or more simulation methodologies (e.g., discrete event and continuous simulation) to model complex systems with both discrete and continuous elements.
   - **Applications**: Healthcare systems, supply chain management, military simulations.
   - **Example**: A hospital emergency department where patient arrivals are discrete events, but the treatment processes include continuous flow.

5. **Stochastic Simulation**:
   - **Definition**: Incorporates randomness and probabilistic elements to model systems that exhibit uncertainty.
   - **Applications**: Financial modeling, risk analysis, inventory management.
   - **Example**: Simulating stock market fluctuations where future prices are influenced by random variables.

6. **Monte Carlo Simulation**:
   - **Definition**: Uses repeated random sampling to compute the results of a model, often used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty.
   - **Applications**: Financial forecasting, project management, reliability engineering.
   - **Example**: Estimating the probability of project completion within a certain time frame given various uncertainties.
