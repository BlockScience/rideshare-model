linear systems control with an emphasis on discrete time/event systems 

I’d doing discrete time LTI, state-estimators, then PID control, then linear system identification, then non-linear system identification, then either hybrid system (mixtures of state machines and continuous dynamics) or stochastic control (dynamic programming)
