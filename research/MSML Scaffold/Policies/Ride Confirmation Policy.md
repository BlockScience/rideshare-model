This policy will hold the logic of whether or not a [[rider]] confirms the price and time are good with them. There could be policy options to enrich behaviors i.e.

1. Riders only confirm if both the time and price are right for them
2. Riders confirm probabilistically where if both are good it is always true but sometimes they still confirm because they need it badly (but with much lower likelihood)

The [[Request Ride Response Space]] passed in the domain will either come out as the codomain if the user goes with the ride, or it will terminate the process. 

This codomain may change or be multiple spaces depending on how the mechanism(s) look.

## Notes

There are possible extensions here if there should be a mechanism that might get called in terminating cases to log a user looking for a ride then closing the app. This kind of thing might be a metric for later enrichment.
