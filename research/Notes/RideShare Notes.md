notes:

systematic vulnerabilities
coordinated behavior - test case

generate weighted directed graph, treat each of the node as a region/location/discrete bucket, edges expected travel time between buckets (weighted), used as substitute for geography. driver can be in bucket but have to move along the graph.

wighted graph with n nodes is a weighted n X n matrix

rider in place place, existing shortest path algorithm (network x) shortest path = input into pricing model

when a driver doesn't have a rider -> random walk

network x python lib

**Zhargam:**  
i think it would also be good for us to start a thread here with references.

- here is the distributed kalman filter reference [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4434303](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4434303)
- here is another paper i like on learning in networks: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0899825612000851](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0899825612000851)
- i also regularly use this tutorial as a reference of distributed systems: [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8716798](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8716798)

Here are useful references for deriving a minimal set of necessary conditions for a stable network under incomplete information and node asymmetry--the main ref is Song & Schaar (2015), working up from the seminal paper of Jackson and Wolinsky (1996), but the others are important to explore compatible learning paradigms and agent optimization horizons. (Working paper versions exist for most of these via e.g. google scholar.)
