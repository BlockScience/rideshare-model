### Concepts

1. **Attribute Space (X)**:
   - An attribute space \(X\) is a set of attributes that describe items
     
2. **Context and Utility**:
   - The context \(c\) represents the circumstances under which an item (ride) is evaluated. In ride-sharing, this could be the passengerâ€™s preferences or current market conditions.
   - The utility function $u_c(x)$ evaluates the value of a ride based on its attributes and the context. Higher utility indicates higher value / more willingness to pay.
     
3. **Fungibility and Differentiation**:
   - Rides are fungible if they provide the same utility in a given context. Differentiation occurs when rides have unique attributes that change their perceived value.

### Applying to Ride-Share model

#### Attributes

The following attributes should be considered:

1. **Time of Day**:
   - Peak hours may have higher demand, leading to higher prices.
     
2. **Location**:
   - Longer distances and ride durations generally command higher prices.
   - Prices may vary based on the pickup and drop-off locations, with certain areas having higher base prices due to demand or traffic conditions.
     
3. **Vehicle Type**:
   - Different vehicle types (e.g., standard, premium) will have different pricing tiers.
     
4. **Demand**:
   - Real-time demand can influence pricing through surge pricing mechanisms.
     
5. **(Passenger/Driver) Preferences**:
   - Preferences such as preferred routes, willingness, comfort levels, and additional services can affect pricing.


#### Ex.
$u_c(x) = \alpha \cdot \text{time\_of\_day} + \beta \cdot \text{distance} + \gamma \cdot \text{location} + \delta \cdot \text{vehicle\_type} + \epsilon \cdot \text{demand} + \zeta \cdot \text{passenger\_preferences} + \eta \cdot \text{driver\_preferences}$

Where:
- $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta, \zeta, \eta$ are weights assigned to each attribute
