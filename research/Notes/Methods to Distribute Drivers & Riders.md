Distributing riders and drivers in a simulation can be done in various ways depending on the goals of the simulation and the realism required. Here are some different methods to distribute riders and drivers:

### 1. **Uniform Distribution**

In a uniform distribution, riders and drivers are placed randomly across all available zones with equal probability. This method is straightforward and ensures an even spread across the grid.

```python
import random

# Initialize riders and drivers with uniform distribution across the zones
num_riders = 10
num_drivers = 10

riders = [Rider(f'Rider {i}', random.choice(list(zones.values()))) for i in range(num_riders)]
drivers = [Driver(f'Driver {i}', random.choice(list(zones.values())), random.choice(driver_preferences)) for i in range(num_drivers)]
```

### 2. **Clustered Distribution**

In a clustered distribution, riders and drivers are grouped into specific areas or "hotspots." This method simulates real-world scenarios where certain areas (e.g., downtown or business districts) have higher demand and supply.

```python
# Define hotspot zones
hotspot_zones = [zones[(2, 2)], zones[(5, 5)], zones[(8, 8)]]

# Initialize riders and drivers with clustered distribution around hotspots
num_riders = 10
num_drivers = 10

riders = [Rider(f'Rider {i}', random.choice(hotspot_zones)) for i in range(num_riders)]
drivers = [Driver(f'Driver {i}', random.choice(hotspot_zones)), random.choice(driver_preferences)) for i in range(num_drivers)]
```

### 3. **Time-Based Distribution**

In time-based distribution, the locations of riders and drivers change based on the time of day. For example, during morning hours, more riders might be in residential areas and drivers near business districts, and vice versa in the evening.

```python
def get_time_based_zone(time_of_day):
    if time_of_day < 12:
        # Morning distribution: more riders in residential areas, drivers in business areas
        rider_zones = [zones[(2, 2)], zones[(3, 3)], zones[(4, 4)]]
        driver_zones = [zones[(7, 7)], zones[(8, 8)], zones[(9, 9)]]
    else:
        # Evening distribution: more riders in business areas, drivers in residential areas
        rider_zones = [zones[(7, 7)], zones[(8, 8)], zones[(9, 9)]]
        driver_zones = [zones[(2, 2)], zones[(3, 3)], zones[(4, 4)]]
    return rider_zones, driver_zones

time_of_day = datetime.now().hour

rider_zones, driver_zones = get_time_based_zone(time_of_day)

# Initialize riders and drivers with time-based distribution
num_riders = 10
num_drivers = 10

riders = [Rider(f'Rider {i}', random.choice(rider_zones)) for i in range(num_riders)]
drivers = [Driver(f'Driver {i}', random.choice(driver_zones)), random.choice(driver_preferences)) for i in range(num_drivers)]
```

### 4. **Proximity-Based Distribution**

In proximity-based distribution, riders and drivers are placed closer together to increase the likelihood of quick matches. This is useful in testing how the system handles high-density scenarios.

```python
# Define a central zone and distribute riders and drivers around it
central_zone = zones[(5, 5)]
nearby_zones = [zones[(x, y)] for x in range(4, 7) for y in range(4, 7)]

# Initialize riders and drivers with proximity-based distribution
num_riders = 10
num_drivers = 10

riders = [Rider(f'Rider {i}', random.choice(nearby_zones)) for i in range(num_riders)]
drivers = [Driver(f'Driver {i}', random.choice(nearby_zones)), random.choice(driver_preferences)) for i in range(num_drivers)]
```

### 5. **Demand-Based Distribution**

In demand-based distribution, the distribution of riders and drivers is based on historical or simulated demand patterns. This method is more complex but can reflect real-world dynamics better.

```python
# Simulate demand hotspots based on historical data
demand_zones = [zones[(1, 1)], zones[(5, 5)], zones[(10, 10)]]
supply_zones = [zones[(3, 3)], zones[(6, 6)], zones[(9, 9)]]

# Initialize riders and drivers with demand-based distribution
num_riders = 10
num_drivers = 10

riders = [Rider(f'Rider {i}', random.choice(demand_zones)) for i in range(num_riders)]
drivers = [Driver(f'Driver {i}', random.choice(supply_zones)), random.choice(driver_preferences)) for i in range(num_drivers)]
```
