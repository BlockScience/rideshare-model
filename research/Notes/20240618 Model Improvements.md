1. Use constants for state names and other frequently used values to improve readability and maintainability.

3. Use a configuration file or a separate module to store driver preferences, simulation parameters, and other customizable settings. This will make it easier to modify the simulation without changing the main code.

4. Implement a more efficient algorithm for finding the nearest available driver. Instead of sorting all drivers based on their distance to the rider, you can use a spatial index or a grid-based approach to quickly find nearby drivers.

5. Use a priority queue or a heap to store ride requests based on their priority (e.g., waiting time, cost). This will allow you to efficiently select the next ride request to process.

6. Implement a logging system to record important events and state changes during the simulation. This will help in debugging and analyzing the simulation results.

7. Use descriptive variable and function names to improve code readability. For example, instead of `d` for driver, use a more descriptive name like `driver`.

8. Break down large functions into smaller, more focused functions to improve code organization and readability. For example, you can extract the logic for updating driver states into separate methods.

9. Use type hints to specify the expected types of function parameters and return values. This will make the code more self-documenting and catch potential type-related errors.

10. Implement error handling and validation to handle unexpected scenarios gracefully, such as when no available driver is found or when invalid input is provided.

11. Use a more sophisticated pricing model that takes into account factors like supply and demand, traffic conditions, and rider preferences. This will make the simulation more realistic and allow for dynamic pricing.

12. Implement a caching mechanism to store frequently accessed data, such as zone distances, to avoid redundant calculations and improve performance.

13. Use parallel processing or multithreading to simulate multiple riders and drivers simultaneously. This will allow for more realistic and efficient simulations, especially for larger-scale scenarios.

14. Implement a visualization component to display the movement of drivers and riders on the grid in real-time. This will make the simulation more engaging and easier to understand.

15. Use a database or a persistent storage mechanism to store simulation data, such as ride history, driver performance, and rider feedback. This will allow for long-term analysis and insights.

16. Implement a testing framework to ensure the correctness and reliability of the simulation code. Write unit tests for critical functions and integration tests for the overall simulation workflow.

17. Document the code using docstrings and comments to explain the purpose, inputs, and outputs of each function and class. This will make the code more maintainable and easier for others to understand.

18. Optimize the code for performance by identifying and eliminating bottlenecks, using efficient data structures, and minimizing unnecessary computations.

19. Implement a configuration management system to manage different versions of the simulation code and track changes over time. Use version control tools like Git to facilitate collaboration and code sharing.
