### **System**

- **Components**:
    - **Riders** who request rides through a mobile application.
    - **Drivers** who use their personal vehicles to fulfill those ride requests.
    - **Matching Engine** which processes ride requests and assigns drivers to riders.
    - **Pricing Algorithm** which determines the cost of each ride based on dynamic pricing models.
    - **Navigation and Route Optimization** which provides drivers with optimal driving directions to the riderâ€™s location and destination.
    - **Demand Prediction Model** which forecasts ride request volumes based on historical data and other factors like time, weather, and local events.
    - **Supply Management** which predicts and influences the number of drivers available based on current demand.

- **Interactions**:
    - Riders enter their pickup and destination locations into the app.
    - The system calculates a fare and estimated pickup time, then shows this information to the rider.
    - Drivers receive ride requests from the system based on their location and the matching algorithm.
    - Drivers and riders are updated in real-time about trip status, route changes, and estimated arrival times.


### Objectives

1. **Maximize Efficiency**:
    - **For Riders**: Minimize the waiting time from when a ride is requested to when the rider is picked up and then transported to their destination.
    - **For Drivers**: Minimize idle time and ensure that the time spent without a passenger (repositioning time) is reduced. Maximize the utilization rate (the proportion of time spent with a passenger in the car).

2. **Optimize Pricing**:
    - Use dynamic pricing to balance supply and demand, ensuring that ride prices are fair and adjusted in real-time based on the current demand, supply availability, and other external factors like traffic and weather.
    - Prevent the system from entering the "danger zone" where pricing or demand-supply mismatches could lead to inefficiencies like long wait times or unfulfilled ride requests.
