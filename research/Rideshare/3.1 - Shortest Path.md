The purpose of this note is to outline a method for deriving the least congested and shortest path for picking up a rider from point A to B, using a weighted directed graph representation. This approach will substitute for the physical geography of the model by considering expected travel times between regions. It includes driver and rider dynamics, efficient driver assignment using shortest path algorithms, a random walk for repositioning idle drivers, and queue management strategies. Additionally, the Discounted Integral Priority Routing (DIPR) algorithm is introduced to prioritize routing based on historical queue lengths, aiming to reduce congestion and optimize routing and pricing dynamically.

### Concept

1. **Weighted Directed Graph Representation**:
    - **Nodes**: Represent regions, locations, or discrete buckets within the service area.
    - **Edges**: Represent the expected travel time between these regions (nodes), acting as a substitute for physical geography.

1. **Graph Structure**:
    - **Weighted Graph**: Modeled as a weighted n×n matrix, where n is the number of nodes (regions/locations). The weight on each edge represents the travel time between nodes.

2. **Driver and Rider Dynamics**:
    - **Drivers**: Drivers can be located in any node (region). They move along the edges of the graph based on travel times.
    - **Riders**: Riders request rides from specific nodes to other nodes.
    - **Driver Assignment**: When a ride request is made, the system uses an existing shortest path algorithm (such as Dijkstra's or A* from the NetworkX Python library) to determine the optimal path and travel time for the driver to reach the rider and complete the ride. This shortest path becomes an input to the pricing model.

3. **Random Walk for Idle Drivers**:
    - When drivers are not assigned to a rider, they perform a random walk along the graph to simulate movement and repositioning within the service area.
    - Zones have parking, doesn't need to be, # of cars self-self equals number of parking spots

4. **Queue Clearing Problem**:
    - This likely involves optimizing the assignment and routing of multiple drivers to multiple riders in a way that clears the queue of ride requests efficiently, minimizing wait times and travel times.

### Design:

1. **Efficient Assignment**:
    - Use shortest path algorithms to quickly determine the optimal paths for drivers to reach riders and complete trips.

1. **Dynamic Pricing Model**:
    - Input from the shortest path algorithm (such as travel time) feeds into the pricing model to dynamically adjust ride prices based on current conditions.

1. **Driver Repositioning**:
    - Implement a random walk algorithm for idle drivers to ensure they are strategically positioned throughout the service area, potentially reducing response times for future ride requests.
      
4. **Queue Management**:
    - Develop a strategy for clearing the queue of ride requests by efficiently matching drivers to riders, possibly using a combination of graph algorithms and optimization techniques.

### Solution

Discounted Integral Priority Routing (DIPR) - a routing strategy aimed at reducing queues in packet networks

- **Motivation**: Traditional backpressure-based algorithms like Backpressure (BP) and Soft Backpressure (SBP) stabilize queues but do not effectively reduce the queue lengths. DIPR is designed to address this issue by incorporating integral control methods.
- **Priority Computation**: The priorities for routing are set based on a discounted integral of the queue lengths. This means that the priority given to each queue at any time is a weighted sum of its historical lengths, with more recent lengths given higher weights.
- **Algorithm**: The algorithm continuously updates priorities and routes packets based on these priorities. This is expected to drive down the number of queued packets, unlike BP and SBP which tend to maintain higher steady-state queue lengths.

### Mathematical Formulation
- **Discounted Integral Priorities**: The priorities at time \( t \) are given by:

$$\theta_t = \sum_{\tau=0}^t \alpha^{t-\tau} q_\tau$$

- **Priority Update**: The priority update rule is:

$$  \theta_t = \alpha \theta_{t-1} + q_t$$

  This rule can be implemented locally without requiring information from neighboring nodes, making it scalable and efficient.
  
1. **Priority**:
	  - In a network represented as an n x n matrix of zones, the DIPR output at each node represents the congestion level or traffic intensity in that zone.
	  - Nodes with higher priorities (resulting from longer queues of cars) indicate areas with higher traffic congestion.

2. **Shortest Path**:
	- The priority values from DIPR can be integrated into the shortest path algorithm used for route optimization. Instead of considering only the physical distance, the algorithm can also factor in the congestion levels indicated by DIPR priorities.
	- This approach transforms the problem from finding the "shortest path" to finding the "least congested path," balancing distance and traffic conditions.

#### Implementation

1. **Model the Network**:
	- Represent the city’s road network as a graph where intersections are nodes and roads are edges.
	- Use real-time traffic data to update the queue lengths at each node, which DIPR will use to calculate priorities.
 
2. **Calculate Priorities Using DIPR**:
	- Apply the DIPR algorithm to determine the priority of each intersection based on the current and past traffic data.
	- Use a suitable discount factor $\alpha$ to ensure recent traffic conditions are weighted more heavily.

3. **Integrate Priorities into Shortest Path Algorithm**:
	- Modify the cost function of the shortest path algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra’s or A* algorithm) to include both the physical distance and the DIPR priority values.
	- For example, the cost of traveling from node \(i\) to node \(j\) can be calculated as:

$$ \text{Cost}_{i,j} = \text{Distance}_{i,j} + \lambda \times \text{Priority}_j $$
Where: 

- $\text{Cost}_{i,j}$ is the combined cost of traveling from zone \(i\) to zone \(j\). 
- $\text{TravelTime}_{i,j}$ is the expected travel time from zone \(i\) to zone \(j\). 
- $\text{Priority}_j$ is the congestion priority of the destination zone \(j\). 
- $\lambda$ is a weight factor that determines the relative importance of congestion priority compared to travel time. 

4. **Dynamic Routing and Pricing**:
   
   - Use the modified shortest path algorithm to determine the optimal route for each ride request, considering both distance and congestion.
   - Update the route and pricing dynamically based on real-time DIPR outputs. For instance, higher priorities (indicating higher congestion) could result in higher prices for rides passing through those areas, reflecting the increased cost of travel time and fuel.
